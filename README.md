# NereidaPipeline
This project structure and setup will allow you to create a reproducible workflow for studying marine biodiversity using R and Python. The use of `r-rix` for environment management, `targets` for pipeline management, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD will ensure that your analyses are reproducible and well-documented
