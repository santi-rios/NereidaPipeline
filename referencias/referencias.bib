  abstract = {Reproducibility is increasingly important to statistical research, but many details are often omitted from the published version of complex statistical analyses. A reader's comprehension is limited to what the author concludes, without exposure to the computational process. Often, the industrious reader cannot expand upon or validate the author's results. Even the author may struggle to reproduce their own results upon revisiting them. R Markdown is an authoring syntax that combines the ease of Markdown with the statistical programming language R. An R Markdown document or presentation interweaves computation, output and written analysis to the effect of transparency, clarity and an inherent invitation to reproduce (especially as sharing data is now as easy as the click of a button). It is an open-source tool that can be used either on its own or through the               RStudio               integrated development environment (               IDE               ). In addition to facilitating reproducible research, R Markdown is a boon to collaboratively minded data analysts, whose workflow can be streamlined by sharing only one master document that contains both code and content. Statistics educators may also find that R Markdown is helpful as a homework template, for both ease-of-use and in discouraging students from copy-and-pasting results from classmates. Training students in R Markdown will introduce to the workforce a new class of data analysts with an ingrained, foundational inclination toward reproducible research.

  abstract = {Abstract             Spatial climate data sets of 1971--2000 mean monthly precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature were developed for the conterminous United States. These 30-arcsec ({$\sim$}800-m) grids are the official spatial climate data sets of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) interpolation method was used to develop data sets that reflected, as closely as possible, the current state of knowledge of spatial climate patterns in the United States. PRISM calculates a climate--elevation regression for each digital elevation model (DEM) grid cell, and stations entering the regression are assigned weights based primarily on the physiographic similarity of the station to the grid cell. Factors considered are location, elevation, coastal proximity, topographic facet orientation, vertical atmospheric layer, topographic position, and orographic effectiveness of the terrain. Surface stations used in the analysis numbered nearly 13 000 for precipitation and 10 000 for temperature. Station data were spatially quality controlled, and short-period-of-record averages adjusted to better reflect the 1971--2000 period.             PRISM interpolation uncertainties were estimated with cross-validation (C-V) mean absolute error (MAE) and the 70\% prediction interval of the climate--elevation regression function. The two measures were not well correlated at the point level, but were similar when averaged over large regions. The PRISM data set was compared with the WorldClim and Daymet spatial climate data sets. The comparison demonstrated that using a relatively dense station data set and the physiographically sensitive PRISM interpolation process resulted in substantially improved climate grids over those of WorldClim and Daymet. The improvement varied, however, depending on the complexity of the region. Mountainous and coastal areas of the western United States, characterized by sparse data coverage, large elevation gradients, rain shadows, inversions, cold air drainage, and coastal effects, showed the greatest improvement. The PRISM data set benefited from a peer review procedure that incorporated local knowledge and data into the development process. Copyright {\copyright} 2008 Royal Meteorological Society},

Some academics in developing nations rely on software that has been illegally copied a copy of the software program. There are several benefits to using R, including the possibility of using software packages for free (open source) and the volume and availability of software packages.

  abstract = {Abstract                        A central tenet of reproducible research is that scientific results are published along with the underlying data and software code necessary to reproduce and verify the findings. A host of tools and software have been released that facilitate such work-flows and scientific journals have increasingly demanded that code and primary data be made available with publications. There has been little practical advice on implementing reproducible research work-flows for large `omics' or systems biology data sets used by teams of analysts working in collaboration. In such instances it is important to ensure all analysts use the same version of a data set for their analyses. Yet, instantiating relational databases and standard operating procedures can be unwieldy, with high ``startup'' costs and poor adherence to procedures when they deviate substantially from an analyst's usual work-flow. Ideally a reproducible research work-flow should fit naturally into an individual's existing work-flow, with minimal disruption. Here, we provide an overview of how we have leveraged popular open source tools, including Bioconductor, Rmarkdown, git version control, R, and specifically R's package system combined with a new tool             DataPackageR,             to implement a lightweight reproducible research work-flow for preprocessing large data sets, suitable for sharing among small-to-medium sized teams of computational scientists. Our primary contribution is the             DataPackageR             tool, which decouples time-consuming data processing from data analysis while leaving a traceable record of how raw data is processed into analysis-ready data sets. The software ensures packaged data objects are properly documented and performs checksum verification of these along with basic package version management, and importantly, leaves a record of data processing code in the form of package vignettes. Our group has implemented this work-flow to manage, analyze and report on pre-clinical immunological trial data from multi-center, multi-assay studies for the past three years.},

The recent and widespread application of DNA sequencing to community composition studies is making large data sets with taxonomic information commonplace. However, compared to typical tabular data, this information is encoded in many different ways and the hierarchical nature of taxonomic classifications makes it difficult to work with. There are many R packages that use taxonomic data to varying degrees but there is currently no cross-package standard for how this information is encoded and manipulated. We developed the R package\&nbsp;taxa to provide a robust and flexible solution to storing and manipulating taxonomic data in R and any application-specific information associated with it.\&nbsp;Taxa provides parsers that can read common sources of taxonomic information (taxon IDs, sequence IDs, taxon names, and classifications) from nearly any format while preserving associated data. Once parsed, the taxonomic data and any associated data can be manipulated using a cohesive set of functions modeled after the popular R package\&nbsp;dplyr. These functions take into account the hierarchical nature of taxa and can modify the taxonomy or associated data in such a way that both are kept in sync.\&nbsp;Taxa is currently being used by the\&nbsp;metacoder and\&nbsp;taxize packages, which provide broadly useful functionality that we hope will speed adoption by users and developers.},

The low cost of data generation is leading us to the ``big data'' era. The availability of big data provides unprecedented opportunities but also raises new challenges for data mining and analysis. In this review, we introduce key concepts in the analysis of big data, including both ``machine learning'' algorithms as well as ``unsupervised'' and ``supervised'' examples of each. We note packages for the R programming language that are available to perform machine learning analyses. In addition to programming based solutions, we review webservers that allow users with limited or no programming background to perform these analyses on large data compendia. J. Cell.

High-throughput sequencing has enabled the study of microbial communities at an unprecedented resolution. Generation of massive amounts of sequencing data has also presented novel challenges to analyzing and visualizing data to make biologically relevant interpretations. We have developed an interactive Metagenome Data Analysis and Visualization (MetaDAVis) tool for 16S rRNA as well as the whole genome sequencing data analysis and visualization to address these challenges using an R Shiny application. MetaDAVis can perform six different types of analyses that include: i) Taxonomic abundance distribution; ii) Alpha and beta diversity analyses; iii) Dimension reduction tasks using PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP; iv) Correlation analysis using taxa- or sample-based data; v) Heatmap generation; and vi) Differential abundance analysis. MetaDAVis creates interactive and dynamic figures and tables from multiple methods enabling users to easily understand their data using different variables. Our program is user-friendly and easily customizable allowing those without any programming background to perform comprehensive data analyses using a standalone or web-based interface.},

One reason for the belated adoption of informatics approaches in ecology is the breadth of ecologically pertinent data (from genes to the biosphere) and its highly heterogeneous nature. The variety of formats, logical structures, and sampling methods in ecology create significant challenges. Cultural barriers further impede progress, especially for the creation and adoption of data standards. Here we describe informatics frameworks for ecology, from subject-specific data warehouses, to generic data collections that use detailed metadata descriptions and formal ontologies to catalog and cross-reference information. Combining these approaches with automated data integration techniques and scientific workflow systems will maximize the value of data and open new frontiers for research in ecology.},

Thus, we surveyed state-of-the-art toolsavailable in the literature, created simulated datasets, and performed benchmarks to design a sensitiveand flexible metagenomic analysis pipeline. Here we present MEDUSA, an efficient pipeline toconduct comprehensive metagenomic analyses. It performs preprocessing, assembly, alignment,taxonomic classification, and functional annotation on shotgun data, supporting user-built dictionariesto transfer annotations to any functional identifier. MEDUSA includes several tools, as fastp, Bowtie2,DIAMOND, Kaiju, MEGAHIT, and a novel tool implemented in Python to transfer annotations toBLAST/DIAMOND alignment results. These tools are installed via Conda, and the workflow ismanaged by Snakemake, easing the setup and execution. Compared with MEGAN 6 CommunityEdition, MEDUSA correctly identifies more species, especially the less abundant, and is more suitedfor functional analysis using Gene Ontology identifiers.},

The metagenomics field is one of the versatile applications in microbiology, where any interaction in the environment involving microorganisms can be the topic of study. Due to this versatility, the number of applications of this omics technology reached its horizons. Agriculture is a crucial sector involving crop plants and microorganisms interacting together. Hence, studying these interactions through the lenses of metagenomics would completely disclose a new meaning to crop health and development. The rhizosphere is an essential reservoir of the microbial community for agricultural soil. Hence, we focus on the R\&D of metagenomic studies on the rhizosphere of crops such as rice, wheat, legumes, chickpea, and sorghum. These recent developments are impossible without the continuous advancement seen in the next-generation sequencing platforms; thus, a brief introduction and analysis of the available sequencing platforms are presented here to have a clear picture of the workflow. Concluding the topic is the discussion about different pipelines applied to analyze data produced by sequencing techniques and have a significant role in interpreting the outcome of a particular experiment. A plethora of different software and tools are incorporated in the automated pipelines or individually available to perform manual metagenomic analysis. Here we describe 8--10 advanced, efficient pipelines used for analysis that explain their respective workflows to simplify the whole analysis process.},

We analyzed the role of these traits in mediating the responses of a planktonic microbial community to nutrient enrichment in an oligotrophic, phosphorus-deficient pond in Cuatro Ci{\'e}negas, Mexico. This is one of the first whole-ecosystem experiments to involve replicated metagenomic assessment. Mean bacterial genome size, GC content, total number of tRNA genes, total number of rRNA genes, and codon usage bias in ribosomal protein sequences were all higher in the fertilized treatment, as predicted on the basis of the assumption that oligotrophy favors lower information-processing costs whereas copiotrophy favors higher processing rates. Contrasting changes in trait variances also suggested differences between traits in mediating assembly under copiotrophic versus oligotrophic conditions. Trade-offs in information-processing traits are apparently sufficiently pronounced to play a role in community assembly because the major components of metabolism---information, energy, and nutrient requirements---are fine-tuned to an organism's growth and trophic strategy.},

Bioinformatic analysis of sequencing results poses a challenge because this involves many different complex steps.SqueezeMeta is a fully automatic pipeline for metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, covering all steps of the analysis. SqueezeMeta includes multi-metagenome support that enables co-assembly of related metagenomes and retrieval of individual genomes via binning procedures. SqueezeMeta features several unique characteristics: co-assembly procedure or co-assembly of unlimited number of metagenomes via merging of individual assembled metagenomes, both with read mapping for estimation of the abundances of genes in each metagenome. It also includes binning and bin checking for retrieving individual genomes. Internal checks for the assembly and binning steps provide information about the consistency of contigs and bins. Moreover, results are stored in a mySQL database, where they can be easily exported and shared, and can be inspected anywhere using a flexible web interface that allows simple creation of complex queries.We illustrate the potential of SqueezeMeta by analyzing 32 gut metagenomes in a fully automatic way, enabling retrieval of several million genes and several hundreds of genomic bins.One of the motivations in the development of SqueezeMeta was producing a software capable of running in small desktop computers and thus amenable to all users and settings. We were also able to co-assemble two of these metagenomes and complete the full analysis in less than one day using a simple laptop computer. This reveals the capacity of SqueezeMeta to run without high-performance computing infrastructure.SqueezeMeta is a complete system covering all steps in the analysis of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes; it is capable of working even in scarce computational resources. It is therefore adequate for in-situ, real time analysis of metagenomes produced by nanopore sequencing. SqueezeMeta can be downloaded from https://github.com/jtamames/SqueezeMeta.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

  abstract = {Metagenomic sequencing provides a culture-independent avenue to investigate the complex microbial communities by constructing metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). A MAG represents a microbial genome by a group of sequences from genome assembly with similar characteristics. It enables us to identify novel species and understand their potential functions in a dynamic ecosystem. Many computational tools have been developed to construct and annotate MAGs from metagenomic sequencing, however, there is a prominent gap to comprehensively introduce their background and practical performance. In this paper, we have thoroughly investigated the computational tools designed for both upstream and downstream analyses, including metagenome assembly, metagenome binning, gene prediction, functional annotation, taxonomic classification, and profiling. We have categorized the commonly used tools into unique groups based on their functional background and introduced the underlying core algorithms and associated information to demonstrate a comparative outlook. Furthermore, we have emphasized the computational requisition and offered guidance to the users to select the most efficient tools. Finally, we have indicated current limitations, potential solutions, and future perspectives for further improving the tools of MAG construction and annotation. We believe that our work provides a consolidated resource for the current stage of MAG studies and shed light on the future development of more effective MAG analysis tools on metagenomic sequencing.},

BarcodingR additionally provides new functions for barcode evaluation, barcoding gap analysis, delimitation comparison analysis, species membership analysis and consensus identification. Comparison with other barcoding methods using 11 empirical data sets indicates that on average, FZKMER (implemented in BarcodingR) and one extant barcoding method BRONX outperform all other methods examined in this study. Two other methods, BP and FZ (both implemented in BarcodingR), present similar performance as SVM and BLOG, respectively, and all display better performance than that of Jrip.

Specifically, researchers are often interested in the potential of a microbial community to carry out a metabolic reaction, but this analysis requires knitting together multiple software tools into a complex pipeline. Thanos offers a user-friendly R package designed for the pathway-centric analysis and visualization of the functions encoded within metagenomic samples. It allows researchers to go beyond taxonomic profiles and find out, quantitatively, which pathways are prevalent in an environment, as well as comparing different environments in terms of their functional potential. The analysis is based on the sequencing depth of the genes of interest, either in the metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) or in the assembled reads (contigs), using a normalization strategy that enables comparison across samples. The package can import the data from multiple formats and offers functions for the visualization of the results as bar plots of the functional profile, box plots of compare functions across samples, and annotated pathway graphs. By streamlining the analysis of the functional potential encoded in microbial communities, Thanos can enable impactful discoveries in all the fields touched by metagenomics, from human health to the environmental sciences.},

  abstract = {Species occurrence records from online databases are an indispensable resource in ecological, biogeographical and palaeontological research. However, issues with data quality, especially incorrect geo-referencing or dating, can diminish their usefulness. Manual cleaning is time-consuming, error prone, difficult to reproduce and limited to known geographical areas and taxonomic groups, making it impractical for datasets with thousands or millions of records. Here, we present CoordinateCleaner, an r-package to scan datasets of species occurrence records for geo-referencing and dating imprecisions and data entry errors in a standardized and reproducible way. CoordinateCleaner is tailored to problems common in biological and palaeontological databases and can handle datasets with millions of records. The software includes (a) functions to flag potentially problematic coordinate records based on geographical gazetteers, (b) a global database of 9,691 geo-referenced biodiversity institutions to identify records that are likely from horticulture or captivity, (c) novel algorithms to identify datasets with rasterized data, conversion errors and strong decimal rounding and (d) spatio-temporal tests for fossils. We describe the individual functions available in CoordinateCleaner and demonstrate them on more than 90 million occurrences of flowering plants from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and 19,000 fossil occurrences from the Palaeobiology Database (PBDB). We find that in GBIF more than 3.4 million records (3.7\%) are potentially problematic and that 179 of the tested contributing datasets (18.5\%) might be biased by rasterized coordinates. In PBDB, 1205 records (6.3\%) are potentially problematic. All cleaning functions and the biodiversity institution database are open-source and available within the CoordinateCleaner r-package.},
